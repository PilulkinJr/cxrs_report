  abstract = {For interpreting fusion rate measurements in present fusion experiments and predicting the fusion performance of future devices or of d-t experiments in present devices, it is important to know the fusion cross-sections as precisely as possible. Usually, it is not measured data that are used, but parametrizations of the cross-section as a function of the ion energy and parametrizations of the Maxwellian reactivity as a function of the ion-temperature. Since the publication of the parametrizations now in use, new measurements have been made and evaluations of the measured data have been improved by applying R-matrix theory. The authors show that the old parametrizations no longer adequately represent the experimental data and present new parametrizations based on R-matrix calculations for fusion cross-sections and Maxwellian reactivities for the reactions D(d,n) 3 He, D(d,p)T, T(d,n) 4 He and 3 He(d,p) 4 He},

  abstract = {High fusion power experiments using DT mixtures in ELM-free H mode and optimized shear regimes in JET are reported. A fusion power of 16.1 MW has been produced in an ELM-free H mode at 4.2 MA/3.6 T. The transient value of the fusion amplification factor was 0.95±0.17, consistent with the high value of n DT (0)τ E dia T i (0) = 8.7 × 10 20 ±20% m -3 s keV, and was maintained for about half an energy confinement time until excessive edge pressure gradients resulted in discharge termination by MHD instabilities. The ratio of DD to DT fusion powers (from separate but otherwise similar discharges) showed the expected factor of 210, validating DD projections of DT performance for similar pressure profiles and good plasma mixture control, which was achieved by loading the vessel walls with the appropriate DT mix. Magnetic fluctuation spectra showed no evidence of Alfvénic instabilities driven by alpha particles, in agreement with theoretical model calculations. Alpha particle heating has been unambiguously observed, its effect being separated successfully from possible isotope effects on energy confinement by varying the tritium concentration in otherwise similar discharges. The scan showed that there was no, or at most a very weak, isotope effect on the energy confinement time. The highest electron temperature was clearly correlated with the maximum alpha particle heating power and the optimum DT mixture; the maximum increase was 1.3±0.23 keV with 1.3 MW of alpha particle heating power, consistent with classical expectations for alpha particle confinement and heating. In the optimized shear regime, clear internal transport barriers were established for the first time in DT, with a power similar to that required in DD. The ion thermal conductivity in the plasma core approached neoclassical levels. Real time power control maintained the plasma core close to limits set by pressure gradient driven MHD instabilities, allowing 8.2 MW of DT fusion power with n DT (0)τ E dia T i (0) ≈ 10 21 m -3 s keV, even though full optimization was not possible within the imposed neutron budget. In addition, quasi-steady-state discharges with simultaneous internal and edge transport barriers have been produced with high confinement and a fusion power of up to 7 MW; these double barrier discharges show a great potential for steady state operation. © 1999, Euratom},

  abstract = {The Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR) (R. J. Hawryluk, to be published in Rev. Mod. Phys.) experiments on high-temperature plasmas, that culminated in the study of deuterium–tritium D–T plasmas containing significant populations of energetic alpha particles, spanned over two decades from conception to completion. During the design of TFTR, the key physics issues were magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibrium and stability, plasma energy transport, impurity effects, and plasma reactivity. Energetic particle physics was given less attention during this phase because, in part, of the necessity to address the issues that would create the conditions for the study of energetic particles and also the lack of diagnostics to study the energetic particles in detail. The worldwide tokamak program including the contributions from TFTR made substantial progress during the past two decades in addressing the fundamental issues affecting the performance of high-temperature plasmas and the behavior of energetic particles. The progress has been the result of the construction of new facilities, which enabled the production of high-temperature well-confined plasmas, development of sophisticated diagnostic techniques to study both the background plasma and the resulting energetic fusion products, and computational techniques to both interpret the experimental results and to predict the outcome of experiments.},

  abstract = {Spectroscopy of line radiation from plasma impurity ions excited by charge-exchange recombination reactions with energetic neutral-beam atoms is rapidly becoming recognized as a powerful diagnostic for magnetically confined tokamak plasmas. Ion temperature, bulk plasma motion, impurity transport, and more exotic phenomena such as fast alpha-particle distributions can all be measured with this technique. In particular, it offers the capability of obtaining space- and time-resolved ion temperature and toroidal plasma rotation profiles with relatively simple optical systems. Cascade-corrected excitation rate coefficients for use in both fully stripped impurity density studies and ion-temperature measurements have been calculated for the principal Δn=1 transitions of He+, C5+, and O7+ with neutral-beam energies of 5-100 keV/amu. Line intensities and profiles can be affected by atomic fine structure, l-mixing collisions, motional Stark effects, and product ions created in the neutral-beam region which drift into the viewing sightline. General estimates of the importance of these effects for the transitions of interest are provided, along with specific examples calculated for the PDX (Poloidal Divertor Experiment) and TFTR (Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor) tokamaks. A fiber optically coupled spectrometer system has been used on PDX to measure visible He+ radiation excited by charge exchange to illustrate some of these points. Central ion temperatures up to 2.4 keV and toroidal rotation speeds up to 1.5×10^7 cm/s were observed.},

  abstract = {The need for quantitative evaluation of complex line emission spectra as observed in hot fusion plasmas initiated a challenging development of sophisticated interpretation tools based on integrating advanced atomic modelling with detailed treatment of the plasma environment. The successful merging of the two worlds has led to routine diagnostic procedures which have contributed enormously to the understanding of underlying plasma processes and also to a wide acceptance of spectroscopy as a reliable diagnostic method. In this paper three characteristic types of spectra of current and continuing interest are presented. The first is that of medium/heavy species with many ionisation stages revealed in survey VUV and XUV spectra. Such species occur as control gases, as wall materials, as ablated heavy species and possible as layered wall dopants for monitoring erosion. The spectra are complex with line-like and quasi-continuum regions and are amenable to advanced `pattern recognition' methods. The second type is of few electron, highly ionised systems observed as line-of-sight integrated passive emission spectra in the soft x-ray region. They are analysed successfully in terms of plasma parameters through matching of observation with predicted synthetic spectra. Examples used here include highly resolved helium-like emission spectra of argon, iron and titanium observed on the tokamaks TEXTOR and Tore Supra. The third type, and the emphasis of this work, comprises spectra linked to active beam spectroscopy, that is, charge exchange recombination spectroscopy (CXRS) and beam emission spectroscopy (BES). In this case, a complex spectrum is again composed of a (usually) dominating active spectrum and an underlying passive emission spectrum. Its analysis requires modelling of both active and passive features. Examples used here are from the CXRS diagnostic at JET and TEXTOR. They display characteristic features of the main light impurity ions (C +6 , He +2 , N +7 , Ne +10 and Ar +18 ), as well as that of the bulk plasma ions, H + , D + and T + . A main conclusion is that spectral complexity is not necessarily negative, but that `complex structures' can provide a rich source of information on the plasma and its parameters—provided it is matched with integrated analysis—and that the methods can have universal applicability. In the present preparatory phase of the next generation fusion experiment ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) the concepts and expectations of complex spectra and integrated data analysis play an important role in the design and optimisation procedure of the ITER diagnostic assembly.},

  abstract  = {Experimental study of the impurity removal from the central plasma region after ECR heating switching on is carried out. The neoclassical impurity accumulation is observed at high Zeff conditions of T-10 plasma in discharges with the high electron density and the low plasma current. Transport calculations with the neoclassical and anomalous diffusion coefficients for fully ionized impurity, are provided to describe the impurities density profiles measured by CXRS diagnostics in various regimes. The central ECR heating leads to the efficient flattening of the impurities density profiles when the neoclassical transport is dominant at the Ohmic phase. Thus, the experiment demonstrates the direct link between the impurity removal effectiveness using ECR heating and the value of the impurity density gradient in the OH plasma. Measured impurity dynamics during the ECRH switch on transient phase allows to make transport calculations and to estimate anomalous transport coefficients in the ECRH regime. The anomalous diffusion coefficient for the fully ionized impurity increases after switching on 1 MW ECRH that is shown by the transport modeling of the impurity removal dynamics. According to the CXRS measurements, during first several tens of milliseconds after ECRH switching on fully ionized impurity removal occurs only in the central region of plasma (probably inside the rs region). It is noticed that the amount of carbon and oxygen particles removed from the central region corresponds to the amount of electrons removed by the density pump-out effect implying the quasineutrality condition. The fact that plasma deuterons weakly participate in the particle removal process is possibly due to the flat deuteron density profile in the central region and thus deuterons have low sensitivity to the anomalous diffusion increase. Analysis of possibility of the impurity removal dynamics application to the study of density pump-out effect is carried out.},

  abstract = {In order to support the operation of ITER and the planned experimental programme an extensive set of plasma and first wall measurements will be required. The number and type of required measurements will be similar to those made on the present-day large tokamaks while the specification of the measurements—time and spatial resolutions, etc—will in some cases be more stringent. Many of the measurements will be used in the real time control of the plasma driving a requirement for very high reliability in the systems (diagnostics) that provide the measurements. The implementation of diagnostic systems on ITER is a substantial challenge. Because of the harsh environment (high levels of neutron and gamma fluxes, neutron heating, particle bombardment) diagnostic system selection and design has to cope with a range of phenomena not previously encountered in diagnostic design. Extensive design and R&D is needed to prepare the systems. In some cases the environmental difficulties are so severe that new diagnostic techniques are required. The starting point in the development of diagnostics for ITER is to define the measurement requirements and develop their justification. It is necessary to include all the plasma parameters needed to support the basic and advanced operation (including active control) of the device, machine protection and also those needed to support the physics programme. Once the requirements are defined, the appropriate (combination of) diagnostic techniques can be selected and their implementation onto the tokamak can be developed. The selected list of diagnostics is an important guideline for identifying dedicated research and development needs in the area of ITER diagnostics. This paper gives a comprehensive overview of recent progress in the field of ITER diagnostics with emphasis on the implementation issues. After a discussion of the measurement requirements for plasma parameters in ITER and their justifications, recent progress in the field of diagnostics to measure a selected set of plasma parameters is presented. The integration of the various diagnostic systems onto the ITER tokamak is described. Generic research and development in the field of irradiation effects on materials and environmental effects on first mirrors are briefly presented. The paper ends with an assessment of the measurement capability for ITER and a forward of what will be gained from operation of the various diagnostic systems on ITER in preparation for the machines that will follow ITER.},

It is shown that the ITER reference inductive scenario with Q = 10, Pfus, = 400 MW, Ip = 15 MA is stable against the high and low n ideal MHD modes without a conducting wall. Steady-state operation with Q > 5 would require a reduced current Ip = 9 MA, enhanced confinement with Hh = 1.5, Bn = 3, high bootstrap fraction = 50% and a reversed magnetic shear configuration.

  abstract = {The use of charge exchange spectroscopy to determine plasma rotation speeds and ion temperature is complicated by the energy dependence of the excitation cross sections. The Doppler-broadened spectral line shape is distorted by the relative velocity between the neutral hydrogen atoms of the injected beam and impurity ions. The asymmetric nature of the energy dependence of this cross section causes a nonmotional shift of the line center and a nonthermal change in the linewidth. These effects vary with the angles between the beam direction, rotation velocity direction, and direction of the viewing sightline. When viewing two neutral beams at different angles on TFTR, the two measurements of vφ(r) show discrepancies of about 20%–30% with each other. The calculation of the spectral intensity profiles using the available excitation rates overcorrects these discrepancies and indicates the need for better excitation coefficients.},

  abstract = {An analytical procedure is presented which enables a fast estimate of collision-energy-dependent cross-section effects on thermal charge exchange spectra. The model is based both on experimental evidence and numerical simulations showing that the observed charge exchange (CX) spectra are essentially Gaussian in their shape. The collision-energy-dependent emission rate leads effectively to a lineshift (apparent velocity), usually to a reduction in linewidth (apparent temperature), and to a change in the effective emission rate averaged over the entire thermal velocity distribution function. It is demonstrated that the cross-section effect can be treated analytically introducing an approximated emission rate factor which retains the characteristics of a Maxwellian velocity distribution function using an exponential expression with only linear and quadratic velocity terms in its exponent. An algebraic deconvolution procedure is described, which enables the reconstruction of true temperature, velocity and intensities from measured CX spectra. Examples taken from a recent JET experimental campaign are used to illustrate the cross-section effects on low-Z impurity CX spectra for a comprehensive variety of neutral beams (deuterium, tritium or helium), target densities, temperatures and toroidal rotation speeds. An overview is given of representative correction factors established for high-power, high-temperature plasmas, as well as for plasmas with combined neutral beam and radiofrequency heating, and for the case of locked modes.},

The charge exchange feature can be isolated from the various composite lines and all three impurities agree on the same temperature within experimental error. Observed column emissivities are converted into absolute impurity densities using a neutral beam attenuation code and charge exchange effective rate coefficients. The models take detailed account of cascading and the influence of the plasma environment in causing l-mixing, and allow the n-dependence of the rate coefficients to be addressed experimentally. Some illustrative results are shown for helium (helium discharge or minority r.f. heating), carbon and oxygen concentrations monitored during characteristic operating regimes.},

The noise level can be enhanced and the signal can be disturbed by the reflection. In this study, the influences of the light reflection on the CXRS measurement have been investigated using a ray tracing simulation.

  abstract = {ITER, the next generation fusion reactor, is currently being constructed with the challenge of demonstrating the technical feasibility of a nuclear fusion driven power plant. In ITER, the generated fusion power will exceed the external heating by a factor 10, generating a large population of fusion-born helium in the plasma that needs to be measured and eventually controlled to prevent fuel dilution. The only method capable of measuring the local density of fully ionized helium in a fusion plasma is charge exchange spectroscopy (CXS), which relies on populating excited levels of plasma ions by charge transfer collisions with hydrogen atoms, injected by a powerful neutral hydrogen beam. The work described in this thesis is focussed on 2 open questions: 'Can the emission by the neutral beam itself be reliably combined with CXS to obtain absolute helium concentrations?' and 'Can CXS be used to measure density profiles of non-thermal ions?'. The quantitative interpretation of beam emission (BES), i.e. relating the observed excited population to the ground state density, has been the subject of investigation by several groups over the last 20 years, leading to different results. In this thesis, collisional-radiative models from different modellers have been compared and inconsistencies, both in the models and in the cross sections that were used, have been solved. The resulting emission rates have been used to compare expected beam densities with measured densities using Balmer-alpha and Balmer-beta beam emission spectra from the JET tokamak. Excellent agreement between the Balmer-alpha and -beta spectra, and reasonable agreement with the expected ground state density was found. The Stark line intensities within the beam emission multiplet have been compared with a newly developed sublevel resolved collisional-radiative model, showing good agreement, and providing an explanation to earlier failed experiments of using the line ratios to obtain information about the magnetic pitch angle. As a side result, beam emission spectroscopy has been used to correct and validate the determination of the fractional energy components in the neutral beams. A setup combining CXS and BES, similar to the one on ITER, has been used on the TEXTOR tokamak to validate the helium concentration measurements during strong helium gas puffs against the increase in electron density. The TEXTOR helium concentration data as well as the beam densities obtained on JET give confidence that the proposed CXS analysis scheme on ITER combining beam emission and charge exchange data will not induce systematic uncertainties larger than 20-30%. Purely statistical errors from fitting the helium and MSE spectrum on ITER are obtained from modelling the spectra and are expected to be lower than 10 over the entire radial range. Measuring fast ions in tokamak plasmas with CXS combines challenges on both the hardware and analysis side to measure and interprete a faint, broad and anisotropic spectrum, polluted by parastic emission and distorted by cross section effects. A high-resolution, high-throughput spectrometer has been commissioned on TEXTOR and the capability to detect the slowing down spectrum of beam injected ions has been demonstrated. The measured spectral shape agrees well with a slowing down model for the beam ions, but strong passive charge exchange emission was detected. Faster detectors and beam modulation is proposed for the TEXTOR diagnostic. Preliminary fast ion density profiles are obtained by sustracting the first frame after the NB switch off, showing a flattening of the core fast ion profile. Fast beam ion spectra have also been obtained on JET, but the signal to noise ratio is rather small due to the limited optical throughput of the diagnostic. Fast helium CX spectra on ITER are modelled and the feasibility to extract the fast ion density profiles is discussed as a function of the optical throughput that could be achieved on the diagnostic. Prospects are limited. Only with coarse wavelength binning and very low contamination with impurity lines could a reasonable signal to noise ratio be obtained.},

  abstract = {Active charge exchange recombination spectroscopy (CXRS) is used in most of the present fusion experiments as a proven tool for local measurements of the main ions in the plasma [R. Isler, Plasma Phys. Controlled Fusion 36, 171 (1994)]. A comprehensive diagnostic coverage of intrinsic and injected impurities is essential for any self-consistent plasma simulation and prediction of plasma performance. In particular, for the assessment of local helium ash densities [M. von Hellermann et al., Plasma Phys. Controlled Fusion 35, 799 (1993)], CXRS will play a key role for future fusion devices such as ITER. However, it should be emphasized that any helium ash analysis is only viable in a fully diagnosed plasma, that is, all other ions need to be measured as well. Two fundamental limitations are considered in the following assessment. First is the detectability of a weak CX signal against a strong background of plasma continuum radiation. A second, equally important requirement is the accuracy with which local neutral beam densities can be established in order to derive absolute ion densities from the extracted active CX signals. The second problem can be approached either by experimental data from beam emission spectroscopy (M. von Hellerman et al., Conference on Advanced Diagnostics for Magnetic and Inertial Fusion Varenna, Sept. 2001), or calculated by beam attenuation codes using electron and both bulk and impurity ion density profiles. This report includes a description of the CXRS measurement concept, the experimental and optical scheme of measurements for ITER (S. Tugarinov et al., Conference on Advanced Diagnostics for Magnetic and Inertial Fusion, Varenna, Sept. 2001), and the main conclusions and recommendation that we have made from the results of a signal-to-noise (SN) value calculations. The main conclusions are the following: CXRS at ITER appears to be a viable diagnostic tool and the projected diagnostic neutral beam will provide adequate SN ratios for spectral analysis. A comprehensive approach to helium ash measurement, making use of a simultaneous measurement of the main low-Z impurities, will considerably increase the overall data consistency and will also significantly reduce the statistical error of each single impurity density determination. Three periscopes located in upper port for the intrinsic impurity measurements will also provide ion temperature, plasma rotation, and deuteron density profiles.},

  abstract = {I would firstly like to congratulate all who have contributed to the preparation of the `Progress in the ITER Physics Basis' (PIPB) on its publication and express my deep appreciation of the hard work and commitment of the many scientists involved. With the signing of the ITER Joint Implementing Agreement in November 2006, the ITER Members have now established the framework for construction of the project, and the ITER Organization has begun work at Cadarache. The review of recent progress in the physics basis for burning plasma experiments encompassed by the PIPB will be a valuable resource for the project and, in particular, for the current Design Review. The ITER design has been derived from a physics basis developed through experimental, modelling and theoretical work on the properties of tokamak plasmas and, in particular, on studies of burning plasma physics. The `ITER Physics Basis' (IPB), published in 1999, has been the reference for the projection methodologies for the design of ITER, but the IPB also highlighted several key issues which needed to be resolved to provide a robust basis for ITER operation. In the intervening period scientists of the ITER Participant Teams have addressed these issues intensively. The International Tokamak Physics Activity (ITPA) has provided an excellent forum for scientists involved in these studies, focusing their work on the high priority physics issues for ITER. Significant progress has been made in many of the issues identified in the IPB and this progress is discussed in depth in the PIPB. In this respect, the publication of the PIPB symbolizes the strong interest and enthusiasm of the plasma physics community for the success of the ITER project, which we all recognize as one of the great scientific challenges of the 21st century. I wish to emphasize my appreciation of the work of the ITPA Coordinating Committee members, who are listed below. Their support and encouragement for the preparation of the PIPB were fundamental to its completion. I am pleased to witness the extensive collaborations, the excellent working relationships and the free exchange of views that have been developed among scientists working on magnetic fusion, and I would particularly like to acknowledge the importance which they assign to ITER in their research. This close collaboration and the spirit of free discussion will be essential to the success of ITER. Finally, the PIPB identifies issues which remain in the projection of burning plasma performance to the ITER scale and in the control of burning plasmas. Continued R&D is therefore called for to reduce the uncertainties associated with these issues and to ensure the efficient operation and exploitation of ITER. It is important that the international fusion community maintains a high level of collaboration in the future to address these issues and to prepare the physics basis for ITER operation.

In the IPB, projections for ITER (1998 Design) were also presented. The IPB also pointed out some outstanding issues. These issues have been addressed by the Participant Teams of ITER (the European Union, Japan, Russia and the USA), for which International Tokamak Physics Activities (ITPA) provided a forum of scientists, focusing on open issues pointed out in the IPB.

  abstract = {High-frequency observations of light emitted from the interactions between plasma ions and injected neutral beam atoms allow the measurement of moderate-wavelength fluctuations in plasma and impurity ion densities. To detect turbulence in the local plasma ion density, the collisionally excited fluorescence from a neutral beam is measured either separately at several spatial points or with a multichannel imaging detector. Similarly, the role of impurity ion density fluctuations is measured using charge exchange recombination excited transitions emitted by the ion species of interest. This technique can access the relatively unexplored region of long-wavelength plasma turbulence with k ρi<<1, and hence complements measurements from scattering experiments. Optimization of neutral beam geometry and optical sightlines can result in very good localization and resolution (Δx≤1 cm) in the hot plasma core region. The detectable fluctuation level is determined by photon statistics, atomic excitation processes, and beam stability, but can be as low as 0.2% in a 100 kHz bandwidth over the 0–1 MHz frequency range. The choices of beam species (e.g., H0, He0, etc.), observed transition (e.g., Hα, Lα, He i singlet or triplet transitions, C vi Δn=1, etc.) are dictated by experiment-specific factors such as optical access, flexibility of beam operation, plasma conditions, and detailed experimental goals. Initial tests on the PBX-M tokamak using the Hα emissions from a heating neutral beam show low-frequency turbulence in the edge plasma region.},

  abstract = {The charge transfer reaction of neutral deuterium beams with impurities enables one of the principle quantitative diagnostic measurements of the hot core fusion plasma; that is, charge exchange spectroscopy. The complementary measurement of beam emission spectroscopy has been fruitful in motional Stark wavelength shift and fluctuation studies, but less so in using absolute measured intensities. In the last two years we have achieved substantial improvement in the quantitative analysis and agreement between the observed and modelled beam emission at the JET Joint Undertaking. This has depended on improved spectral fitting of the overlayed D α motional Stark multiplet, self-consistent beam emission and impurity charge exchange modelling and analysis, and revision of the data entering the modelling of the beam emission process. The paper outlines the present JET beam emission diagnostic system and the collisional radiative modelling of deuterium beam stopping and emission. The nature and organization of the effective derived data directly used in experimental interpretation at JET are described and some results of spectral analysis of deuterium beam emission given. The practical implementation of the methods described here is part of the ADAS Project.},

  abstract = {In ITER, one of the key issues to achieve 400 s driven-burn operation at Q about 10 (Technical Basis for the ITER-FEAT Outline Design—Section I-3.2.2.IAEA) is helium ash accumulation. As a result, the real-time measurement of the thermalised helium density profile in the confinement region is of fundamental importance. This paper outlines the design of a modulated, 100 keV, hydrogen, diagnostic neutral beam (DNB), together with preliminary calculations of the performance for the measurement of helium ash by charge exchange recombination spectroscopy (CXRS). The DNB uses a negative ion beam as the primary beam to achieve a required performance with acceptable system efficiency (a higher neutralisation efficiency and smaller beam divergence). This uses the same negative ion source as the ITER H&CD injectors, coupled to a single stage accelerator. The design concept and hence the geometry of the beamline components, i.e. the neutraliser and the residual ion dump and the calorimeter, are similar to those utilised for the H&CD injectors with some minor differences due to the lower beam energy and power. An overview of the design is presented giving the basic information on beam transmission and neutralisation, gas flow and pumping. Selected aspects of the design of the high heat flux components are included. Specific layout and safety requirements of the ITER plant require the installation of the DNB within the common secondary confinement of the NB H&CD system (the NB cell); as a consequence, the DNB has to share the vacuum vessel access through a single port with one of the H&CD injectors.},

Differential velocity measurements isolate the line-integrated poloidal velocity from apparent flows due to the energy-dependent charge exchange cross section. Six f/1.8 spectrometers measure 276 spectra to obtain 75 active and 63 background channels every 10 ms. The local measurements from a similar midplane toroidal viewing system are mapped into two dimensions to allow the inversion of poloidal line-integrated measurements to obtain local poloidal velocity profiles.

Er is negative in the L mode and becomes more negative in the H mode; vθ increases in magnitude at the transition. In addition, the radial gradients (shear) of vθ and Er are large and these gradients also increase at the L-H transition. These results are based on measurements of Doppler shifts of light emitted by He II ions, located in a region about 1–3 cm inside the separatrix. These observations have been made with horizontally viewing and vertically viewing spectrometer systems on the DIII-D tokamak. The nearly orthogonal views of these systems are used to determine the plasma’s flow velocity in terms of the orthogonal sets vθ and vφ or of vper and vpar. Knowledge of vper is used to calculate Er from the force balance equation for a single ion species. The existing results impose constraints on theories of the L-H transition.

These measurements play a crucial role in the understanding of the physics of edge phenomena such as edge transport barrier formation and enhanced light microscopes. The diagnostic also has a more central view of the plasma with a third periscope that faces up towards the top of the vessel. This is a new configuration for the diagnostic and allows the poloidal rotation velocity profile to be measured further in towards the plasma core than previously possible. The new upward facing, core plasma viewing arrangement provides the advantage that the spatial evolution of the internal transport barrier can be tracked from its formation.

The datasets generated by these CR models are needed for the modelling of beam ion deposition and (excited) beam densities in current experiments, and the reliability of these data will be crucial to obtain helium ash densities on ITER combining charge exchange and beam emission spectroscopy. Good agreement between the different CR models for the neutral beam (NB) is found, if corrections to the fundamental cross sections are taken into account. First the H α and H β beam emission spectra from JET are compared with the expected intensities. Second, the line ratios within the Stark multiplet are compared with the predictions of a sublevel resolved model. The measured intensity of the full multiplet is ≈30% lower than expected on the basis of beam attenuation codes and the updated beam emission rates, but apart from the atomic data this could also be due to the characterization of the NB path and line of sight integration and the absolute calibration of the optics. The modelled n = 3 to n = 4 population agrees very well with the ratio of the measured H α to H β beam emission intensities. Good agreement is found as well between the NB power fractions measured with beam emission in plasma and on the JET Neutral Beam Test Bed. The Stark line ratios and σ/π intensity ratio deviate from a statistical distribution, in agreement with the CR model in parabolic states from Marchuk et al ( 2010 J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys.

It provides an introduction to nuclear fusion and its status and prospects, and features specialized chapters written by leaders in the field, presenting the main research and development concepts in fusion physics. It starts with an introduction to the case for the development of fusion as an energy source. Magnetic and inertial confinement are addressed. Dedicated chapters focus on the physics of confinement, the equilibrium and stability of tokamaks, diagnostics, heating and current drive by neutral beam and radiofrequency waves, and plasma-wall interactions. While the tokamak is a leading concept for the realization of fusion, other concepts (helical confinement and, in a broader sense, other magnetic and inertial configurations) are also addressed in the book. At over 1100 pages, this publication provides an unparalleled resource for fusion physicists and engineers.},

In this paper, we start from an existing kinetic neutral particle code already well adapted to divertor applications, and extend this from the ‘particle’ simulation to an analogue ‘photon gas’ simulation. It is shown how this can be achieved and that a quite flexible and detailed divertor radiation transport code can conveniently be obtained.

  abstract = {During 1997 JET was operated for an extensive period using a D–T mixture (DTE1). Changes in the design and operation of diagnostic systems made over the years in preparation for this phase are described. A number of diagnostic techniques have been deployed to measure the deuterium and tritium content of the plasma during DTE1 and their results are compared. All diagnostics with a direct vacuum interface with the main vessel have been fitted with tritium compatible pumps and their exhaust gases have been re-routed to the active gas handling plant. All items on the torus which could lead to a significant leak in the event of failure, were required to have double containment. Therefore, all windows, and a majority of bellows and feedthroughs, were designed and installed with a double barrier. Heated fibre hoses were installed to transmit plasma light beyond the biological shield for spectroscopic purposes. Blind fibres and fibre loops were also installed to study the effects of higher neutron fluxes on these fibres. A radiation-hardened video camera was installed to monitor the plasma during the DTE1 discharges. Extra shielding was installed on a number of diagnostics to deal with the higher neutron fluxes during DTE1. The effect of neutron radiation on electronics in the Torus Hall was studied. During DTE1 the tritium fraction was measured at the edge and in the core using several diagnostic methods. High resolution Balmer α line spectroscopy gave a measurement typical of the plasma edge region. In the JET sub-divertor volume the tritium concentration of the neutral gas was measured using Balmer α spectroscopy of a Penning gauge discharge. Using Neutral Particle Analysis, the tritium concentration was measured typically in a zone 20–40 cm from the plasma edge. Local core measurements of the tritium fraction have been made using active Balmer α charge exchange spectroscopy. The error on this measurement is, however, large,~30%. After the discharge the tritium fraction of the exhaust was measured using the exhaust monitoring system. Using short deuterium neutral injection pulses allowed neutron rate measurements of the tritium concentration in the core region. A further technique used the measured neutron rate and calculated neutron rate from other plasma parameters to determine the tritium concentration.},

Fast ion features can be inferred from the Doppler shifted spectrum of Balmer-alpha light from energetic hydrogenic atoms. This paper will focus on the validation of FIDA measurements performed using MHD-quiescent discharges in 2015 campaign. Two codes have been applied to calculate the Dalpha spectrum: one is a Monte Carlo code, Fortran 90 version FIDASIM, and the other is an analytical code, Simulation of Spectra (SOS). The predicted SOS fast-ion spectrum agrees well with the measurement; however, the level of fast-ion part from FIDASIM is lower. The discrepancy is possibly due to the difference between FIDASIM and SOS velocity distribution function. The details will be presented in the paper to primarily address comparisons of predicted and observed spectrum shapes/amplitudes.},

Two independent observation ports, one with a view perpendicular to the magnetic field in the centre of the plasma and a second multichord viewing arrangement, approximately tangential to the toroidal field, provide radially and temporally resolved information on the velocity distribution function comprising the populations of both fast and thermalized alpha particles. The fuelling process is characterized by a change-over from a distinctly non-Maxwellian distribution function to a dominantly Maxwellian distribution and also by a broadening of the deduced fast ion density radial profile. The fast particle component in the observed composite charge exchange spectrum is found to be in excellent agreement with predictions are based on anisotropic velocity distribution functions obtained from the analytical solution of the neutral injection Fokker-Planck equation. Signal-to-noise levels in the measurement of fast alpha particle in the JET helium fuelling campaign are extrapolated to thermonuclear-fusion alpha particle density levels expected for the D-T phase of JET. It is shown that beam penetration and not competing continuum radiation is a major constraint, and that acceptable (hydrogen or helium) neutral beam power and energy requirements promise a feasible CX alpha particle diagnosis in the core of next-step devices such as ITER.},

  abstract = {Hydrogenic fast-ion populations are common in toroidal magnetic fusion devices, especially in devices with neutral beam injection.

The intensity of this emission is weak compared with the signals from the injected neutrals, the warm (halo) neutrals and the cold edge neutrals, but, for a favourable viewing geometry, the emission is Doppler shifted away from these bright interfering signals. Signals from fast ions are detected in the DIII-D tokamak. When the electron density exceeds ∼7 × 1019 m−3, visible bremsstrahlung obscures the fast-ion signal. The intrinsic spatial resolution of the diagnostic is ∼5 cm for 40 keV amu−1 fast ions. The technique is well suited for diagnosis of fast-ion populations in devices with fast-ion energies (∼30 keV amu−1), minor radii (∼0.6 m) and plasma densities (⪅1020 m−3) that are similar to those of DIII-D.},

  abstract = {The charge exchange spectroscopy (CES) system on Korea Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research (KSTAR) was installed last year and had been applied to measure the C VI ion temperature and rotation velocity profiles. The ion temperature and rotation velocity profiles had been estimated from the C VI 5290.5 Å (n = 8–7) charge-exchange spectrum signal measured by a Czerny-Turner type spectrometer and a thinned back-illuminated charge coupled device (CCD) camera. However, the Czerny-Turner type spectrometer used for the KSTAR CES system showed so low signal to noise ratio for KSTAR plasmas in the 2010 experimental campaign that the time resolution of the CES system had been limited to 100 ms due to the increased exposure time of the attached CCD camera. Then, new two-grating spectrometer had been developed in order to improve the time resolution of the CES system. The spectrometer consists of two gratings (1200 g/mm and 1800 g/mm each) with additive configuration, concave mirrors (f = 50 cm), and a cylindrical lens (f = 50 cm). The time resolution of the CES system increases by a factor of 2–4 with the two-grating spectrometer. The C VI ion temperature and rotation velocity profiles obtained by the two-grating spectrometer are compared to those by Czerny-Turner type spectrometer in this paper.},

At the plasma boundary, we find a strong enhancement of the main-ion toroidal velocity that exceeds the impurity velocity by a factor of two. The unique combination of experimentally measured main-ion and impurity profiles provides a powerful quasi-neutrality constraint for reconstruction of tokamak H-mode pedestals.},

The method is based on the observation that the different polarization components behave collectively like separate entities, with simple relations. The entire Zeeman pattern can then be reduced to just three components, whose dependence on the magnetic field and the temperature can be described by only three numerical parameters. This makes it possible to include the influence of the Zeeman effect directly into ion temperature diagnostic procedures with minimal increase in the required computational effort and without the need for pre-calculated correction factors. We have tabulated such parametrizations—which are accurate for a wide range of fields and temperatures, even for cases when the total line-shape is no longer Gaussian—for 44 commonly studied hydrogen-like transitions. The effects of non-statistical population distribution in the upper sub-levels are briefly discussed, and we also note a temperature-dependent wavelength shift of the centre positions of the transitions.},

  abstract = {An edge toroidal charge exchange recombination spectroscopy (eCXRS) diagnostic, based on a heating neutral beam injection (NBI), has been deployed recently on the Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST). The eCXRS, which aims to measure the plasma ion temperature and toroidal rotation velocity in the edge region simultaneously, is a complement to the exiting core CXRS (cCXRS). Two rows with 32 fiber channels each cover a radial range from ∼2.15 m to ∼2.32 m with a high spatial resolution of ∼5-7 mm. Charge exchange emission of Carbon VI CVI at 529.059 nm induced by the NBI is routinely observed, but can be tuned to any interested wavelength in the spectral range from 400 to 700 nm. Double-slit fiber bundles increase the number of channels, the fibers viewing the same radial position are binned on the CCD detector to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, enabling shorter exposure time down to 5 ms. One channel is connected to a neon lamp, which provides the real-time wavelength calibration on a shot-to-shot basis. In this paper, an overview of the eCXRS diagnostic on EAST is presented and the first results from the 2015 experimental campaign will be shown. Good agreements in ion temperature and toroidal rotation are obtained between the eCXRS and cCXRS systems.},

The values of various impurities densities, measured with the use of passive spectral diagnostics in the visible (Zeff), active charge exchange measurements (He, C, O), and integral bolometric measurements with absolute extreme ultraviolet detectors (Fe, W) are shown. The experimental data show that accumulation level is growing with impurity nuclear charge and determined by the parameter γ, which is common for all sorts of impurities. Accumulation process is determined by neoclassical processes and begins with the increase of impurity content in the plasma and ends with the formation of density profiles more peaked than the ne(r). In discharges with low γ anomalous transport completely dominates. So it prevents the impurity accumulation and flattens their density profiles down to the ne(r). These observations correlates with measured negative (positive) plasma potential in discharges with high γ (low γ). 1D modelling using ASTRA and STRAHL transport codes is performed to describe the behaviour of impurities in a wide range of T-10 ohmic regimes. It is shown that the coefficients of anomalous transport Dan and Van established in Krupin et al (1983 Sov. J. Plasma Phys. 9 529–36) and Krupin et al (1985 12th EPS Conf. on Plasma Physics) by describing the density dynamics of injected argon and potassium ions are applicable for the modelling of the He, C, O, W impurity density profiles and their sources. The analysis of the obtained results allows us to state the existence of a common dependence of the anomalous transport for all ions (impurities and deuterons) on the discharge parameters in the T-10 ohmic regimes.},

Параллельно изучается влияние примесного состава плазмы на процессы переноса, для чего необходимо, в частности, измерять пространственные распределения электронной температуры плазмы Te. Эту величину на Т-10 измеряют с помощью диагностик элекронно-циклотронного излучения (ЭЦИ), мягкого рентгеновского излучения и томсоновского рассеяния. В данной работе представлено описание модернизированной диагностики ЭЦИ на Т-10 и приведены результаты измерений профилей Te с помощью этой диагностики в режимах с чисто вольфрамовым лимитером и с дополнительным литиевым лимитером.
ЭЦИ измеряется в необыкновенной моде на 2-й гармонике и в обыкновенной моде на 1-й гармонике с помощью гетеродинных СВЧ-приёмников. Для используемых приёмников характерна температурная нестабильность, что вызывает необходимость их регулярной калибровки при помощи специальных импульсов с варьированием магнитного поля. Для снижения необходимой частоты калибровок диагностика была оборудована эталонными источниками шума. Кроме того, установлен дополнительный радиометр 3-мм диапазона.
В более ранних экспериментах наблюдалось, что профили электронной температуры в омическом режиме подобны профилям квадрата электронной плотности ne2(r) (измеряемой на Т-10 HCN-лазерным и СВЧ-интерферометрами). Однако в некоторых режимах с литиевым лимитером по спектрам ЭЦИ наблюдалось уширение профилей Te(r) по сравнению с профилями ne2(r), что связывается с уменьшением эффективного заряда плазмы и излучения на периферии. В самом деле, многоканальные болометрические измерения (с помощью пироэлектрических датчиков и детекторов AXUV) показали значительное уменьшение излучения примесей в центральной области и в меньшей степени — на периферии. Полученный результат свидетельствует об уменьшении поступления вольфрама в центральную область плазмы [1]. 
Представляет интерес исследование феноменологических зависимостей формы профилей электронной температуры и плотности от примесного состава плазмы, концентрации примесей и пространственного распределения радиационных потерь. В работе представлены предварительные данные по поиску таких зависимостей, существенных для проводимых на Т-10 исследований влияния примесного состава на процессы переноса [2].

Substantial progress has been achieved on the physics side including comprehensive performance studies based on an advanced predictive code, which simulates active and passive features of the expected spectral ranges. The simulation has enabled detailed specifications for an optimized instrumentation and has helped to specify suitable diagnostic neutral beam parameters.
Four ITER partners share presently the task of developing a suite of ITER active beam diagnostics, which make use of the two 0.5 MeV/amu 18 MW heating neutral beams and a dedicated 0.1 MeV/amu, 3.6 MW diagnostic neutral beam. The IN ITER team is responsible for the DNB development and also for beam physics related aspects of the diagnostic. The RF will be responsible for edge CXRS system covering the outer region of the plasma (1>r/a>0.4) using an equatorial observation port, and the EU will develop the core CXRS system for the very core (0<r/a<0.7) using a top observation port. Thus optimum radial resolution is ensured for each system with better than a/30 resolution. Finally, the US will develop a dedicated MSE system making use of the HNBs and two equatorial ports. With appropriate modification, these systems could also potentially provide information on alpha particle slowing-down features..
On the engineering side, comprehensive preparations were made involving the development of an observation periscope, a neutron labyrinth optical system and design studies for remote maintenance including the exchange of the first mirror assembly, a critical issue for the operation of the CXRS diagnostic in the harsh ITER environment.
Additionally, an essential change of the orientation of the DNB injection angle and specification of suitable blanket aperture has been made to avoid trapped particle damage to the first wall.},

Beam Emission Spectroscopy (BES) is proposed as indispensable cross‐calibration tool for absolute local impurity density measurements and also for the continuous monitoring of the neutral beam power deposition profile. Finally, a full exploitation of the ‘Motional Stark Effect’ pattern is proposed to deduce local pitch angles, total magnetic fields and possibly radial electric fields.
For the proposed active beam spectroscopy diagnostic on ITER comprehensive performance studies have been carried out. Estimates of expected spectral signal‐to‐noise ratios are based on atomic modelling of neutral beam stopping and emissivities for CXRS, BES and background continuum radiation as well as extrapolations from present CXRS diagnostic systems on JET, Tore Supra, TEXTOR and ASDEX‐UG.
Supplementary to thermal features a further promising application of CXRS has been proposed recently for ITER, that is a study of slowing‐down alpha particles in the energy range up to 2 MeV making use of the 100 keV/amu DNB (Diagnostic Neutral Beam) and the 500 keV/amu HNB (Heating Neutral Beam). Synthetic Fast Ion Slowing‐Down spectra are evaluated in terms of source rates and slowing‐down parameters.},

  abstract = {The EIRENE neutral gas transport Monte Carlo code has been developed initially for TEXTOR since the early 1980s. It is currently applied worldwide in most fusion laboratories for a large variety of different purposes. The main goal of code development was to provide a tool to investigate neutral gas transport in magnetically confined plasmas. But, due to its flexibility, it also can be used to solve more general linear kinetic transport equations by applying a stochastic rather than a numerical or analytical method of solution. Major applications of EIRENE are in connection with plasma fluid codes, in particular with the various versions of the B2 two-dimensional plasma edge fluid code. The combined code package B2-EIRENE was developed, again initially for TEXTOR applications, in the late 1980s. It too has become a standard tool in plasma edge science. It is currently mainly used for divertor configurations, such as by the ITER central team, to assist the design of the ITER divertor. Both the EIRENE and B2-EIRENE concepts are introduced and illustrated with sample applications.},

The interferometer is absolutely calibrated using the hot/cold technique and, in consequence, the spatial profile of the plasma electron temperature is determined from the measurements. The current state of the interferometer hardware, the calibration setup, and the analysis technique for calibration and plasma operation are described. A new, full-system, absolute calibration employing continuous data acquisition has been performed recently and the calibration method and results are presented. The noise level in the measurement is very low and as a result the electron cyclotron emission spectrum and thus the spatial profile of the electron temperature are determined to within ±5% and in the most relevant region to within ±2%. The new calibration shows that the absolute response of the system has decreased by about 15% compared to that measured previously and possible reasons for this change are presented. Temperature profiles measured with the Michelson interferometer are compared with profiles measured independently using Thomson scattering diagnostics, which have also been recently refurbished and recalibrated, and agreement within experimental uncertainties is obtained.},

In 2010 a refurbishment of the diagnostic was started, with as main goals to improve its performance and to test the potential of new detectors  hich are considered as candidates for ITER. During the subsequent years a wide range of activities was performed aimed at increasing the diagnostic's light throughput, improvement of signal to noise ratio and amendment of the calibration procedures. Previously used MA-2 detectors were replaced by fast GaAsP detectors with much higher average QE. After all the changes were implemented, a significant improvement of the measured data was achieved. Statistical errors of measured temperature and density were reduced by a factor of 2 or more, depending on plasma conditions, and comfortably surpassed the values requested for ITER Core Thomson Scattering (10% for Te and 5% for ne). Excellent agreement with other diagnostics (conventional High Resolution Thomson Scattering, ECE, Reflectometer) was achieved over a wide range of plasma conditions. It was demonstrated that together with long term reliability and modest access port requirements, LIDAR can provide measurements of a quality similar to a conventional imaging Thomson Scattering instrument.},

Durst, et al., 1992). Very recently, the first measurements of the energy distribution of slowing-down D-T fusion α particles have been reported (McKee, et al., 1995). An examination of the proposed measurement requirements for ITER (ITER 1995), as developed by the ITER JCT in consultation with the ITER Diagnostic Experts Group and diagnosticians from around the world, reveals several obvious candidates for application of diagnostic neutral beams (DNB’s). Of these, the one for which there appears to be no alternative whatsoever, is measurement of the thermalized helium density profile in the confinement region. Since helium ash accumulation is one of the key physics issues to be tested in long pulse (> 1000 second) operation, the inability to measure this quantity accurately in real time would be a significant handicap and could conceivably compromise some of the main ITER missions. A diagnostic beam, combined with charge exchange recombination spectroscopy (CXRS) will be able to provide this measurement.},

A 3rd HNB injector is foreseen as an upgrade option.

The significant R&D effort necessary to meet the design requirements will be provided in the Neutral Beam Test Facility (NBTF), which is to be constructed in Padua, Italy. This paper gives an overview of the current status of the neutral beam (NB) systems and the chosen configuration. The ongoing integration effort into the ITER plant is highlighted and open interface issues are identified. It is shown how installation and maintenance logistics has influenced the design. ITER operating scenarios are briefly discussed, including start‐up and commissioning. For example it is now envisaged to have a low current hydrogen phase of ITER operations, essentially for commissioning of the many auxiliary systems used on ITER. The low current limits the achievable plasma density, and hence the NB energy due to shine through limitations. Therefore a possible reconfiguration of the auxiliary heating systems is now being discussed. Other NB related issues identified by the ongoing design review process are emphasized and possible impact on the implementations of the HNB and DNB systems is indicated.},

The plume emission is indistinguishable from the active charge exchange signal when standard analysis of the spectra is applied and its intensity is of comparable magnitude for ASDEX Upgrade conditions, leading to a significant overestimation of the He2+ densities if not properly treated. Furthermore, the spectral line shape of the plume emission is non-Gaussian and leads to wrong ion temperature and flow measurements when not taken into account. A kinetic model for the helium plume emission has been developed for ASDEX Upgrade. The model is benchmarked against experimental measurements and is shown to capture the underlying physics mechanisms of the plume effect, as it can reproduce the experimental spectra and provides consistent values for the ion temperature, plasma rotation, and He2+ density.},

A comparison between the modelled intensity of the synthetic spectra and experimental PCX data also allows a consistency check of neutral density and its radial distribution.},

The resulting q(r) profile is very broad and its central value, q(0), is significantly below 1, which has important implications for theoretical models of sawteeth.},

The originally apparent differences for the projected performance of a CXRS diagnostic for ITER could be successfully resolved by sorting out differences assumptions, choosing eventually optimised parameters for the future ITER geometry and instrumentation. At the same time, have extrapolations of existing CXRS diagnostic systems, e.g. JET, provided a firm guide-line for a realistic frame-work of expected performance parameters.},

  abstract = {Beam Emission spectroscopy (BES) [1,2,3,4] has been considered for quite a while as an important collateral tool to active charge exchange spectroscopy (CXRS). In addition to its application in magnetic field measurements via the Motional Stark effect [5,6] it is of equal interest for the deduction of local neutral beam densities. For higher levels of accuracy in CXRS data evaluation, that is, the deduction of local impurity ion densities from measured CX spectral intensities and (usually) calculated neutral beam densities, contributions of excited state populations need to be taken into account. The Charge Exchange Analysis Package (CHEAP), which has been developed at JET, calculates the beam n=2 population and in a second step a hybrid emission rate, which is the sum of ground-state and excited state contributions.},

  abstract = {Emission from impurity ions excited by charge exchange with injected beam neutrals is widely used to provide local measurements of ion temperature, velocity, and density. Following the charge exchange process, hydrogenic impurity ions travel along magnetic field lines and may be excited by electron impact from the ground state before they are ionized, producing “plume” emission. This nonlocal emission from plume ions that drift into view can adversely affect the interpretation of charge exchange spectra. Carbon plume emission is observed in the background sightlines of the charge exchange recombination spectroscopy diagnostic of the National Spherical Torus Experiment. In plasmas with high rotation, superthermal flow of carbon ions produces a near Gaussian line shape for the plume emission. Modeling of the production, electron impact excitation, and ionization of the plume ions along the magnetic field lines yields line widths and line shifts consistent with observations. A radial shift between the measured and modeled plume brightness profiles is observed. Plume emission is observed on sightlines that equilibrium reconstruction indicates are not connected to the neutral beam volume, indicating a possible new constraint for the equilibrium reconstruction.},
